# PasswordGenerator

## Description

This is a random password generator created using JavaScript. When the "generate password" button is selected, it will take the user through a number of prompts. The prompts include asking them how long they would like their password to be (between 8 and 128 letters), if they want it to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. Once the user is done responding to the prompts, a random password will appear on the screen using the criteria that they selected. If they select a password length that is not between 8 and 128 characters they will be prompted to select a different length that is in those bounds.
